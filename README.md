A Multi-City Analysis of Bus Transit Development Under China’s Transit Metropolis Initiative

The effectiveness of bus transit development under large-scale national policies, such as China’s Transit Metropolis Initiative (TMI), in shaping sustainable urban mobility remains underexplored. This study evaluates bus system development across 35 major cities from 2010 to 2019, focusing on service quantity (bus ridership) and service quality (resident satisfaction). While TMI expanded bus fleets, routes, and dedicated lanes, ridership declined despite improved satisfaction. The strongest benefits of TMI were observed in cities with lower initial ridership and longer participation, emphasizing the need to prioritize underdeveloped transit systems and ensure sustained national policy support. Fleet expansion was most effective in cities with lower baseline ridership, while bus lane expansion improved service quality, particularly in moderately performing cities. However, network expansion did not significantly enhance ridership or satisfaction, challenging conventional transit planning. These findings highlight the need for adaptive, user-centered strategies and a national transit performance monitoring system for evidence-based policymaking.
